MissingOutputException in rule get_grid_center in file /data/karim_thesis/AutoDock-vina-snakemake-pipeline/Snakefile.py, line 45:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/proteins_gpf/zAR.gpf (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
